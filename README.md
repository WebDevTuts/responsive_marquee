# Creating a Responsive Homepage Marquee

While there are plenty of prebuilt sliders, carousels, and marquee tools available for free on the web, there will come a time when you need a design that's more custom. In this course, you will learn how to build your own responsive promotional marquee from the ground up with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The end result is interactive, attractive and responsive, adapting both the content and user experience to fit small screens.
